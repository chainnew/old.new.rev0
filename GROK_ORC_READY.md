## 🔧 **Updated Files**

1. **`/app/api/chat/route.ts`**
   - Now uses `API_KEYS.orchestrator` (Key #4)
   - Auto-detects project scopes
   - Calls backend orchestrator

2. **`/backend/main.py`**
   - Agent registry renamed:
     - `frontend_architect` (was `primary`)
     - `backend_integrator` (was `code`)
     - `deployment_guardian` (was `eterna_port`)
   - Legacy aliases kept for compatibility

3. **`/backend/hive_mind_db.py`**
   - Updated `AgentSchema` to support new roles
   - 3-agent swarm mode: `start_swarm_from_scope(scope, num_agents=3)`
   - Legacy 5-agent mode still works

4. **`/backend/orchestrator_agent.py`**
   - New task templates for 3 specialized agents
   - Updated `_populate_planner_tasks()` to handle both old/new roles

5. **`/backend/agent_prompts.py`** ⭐ NEW
   - Complete system prompts for all 3 agents
   - "The Stack That Ships" embedded in each
   - Modular execution instructions
   - MCP tool references

## 🔍 **What Each Agent Does**

### **grok-orc (Orchestrator)** - The Commander
- Talks to user in chat
- Detects: "Build X with Y features"
- Breaks down into 6 must-haves:
  1. Project name
  2. Goal (pain point solved)
  3. Tech stack (The Stack That Ships)
  4. Features list
  5. Competitors analyzed
  6. Timeline + Scope of works
- Creates swarm with 3 agents
- Assigns tasks to agents
- Updates user with planner link

### **Frontend Architect** - The Designer/Builder
- **Input**: Subtasks from orchestrator (wireframes, components, state)
- **Execution**:
  1. Query DB: `SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE agent_id = 'frontend-architect-...'`
  2. For each task:
     - Design wireframe (Figma/Shadcn specs)
     - Generate Next.js code (`/app/products/page.tsx`)
     - Integrate TanStack Query (API calls)
     - Setup Zustand store (`lib/cart-store.ts`)
     - Add Clerk auth (`middleware.ts`)
  3. Call MCP tools: `code-gen`, `shadcn-gen`, `browser`
  4. Update DB: `UPDATE tasks SET status='completed', data={'code': '...'}`
- **Output**: Working Next.js frontend on localhost:3000

### **Backend Integrator** - The Connector
- **Input**: DB schema, API routes, Stripe integration tasks
- **Execution**:
  1. Design Prisma schema (`schema.prisma`)
  2. Generate API routes (`/api/products`, `/api/checkout`)
  3. Integrate Stripe:
     - Checkout sessions
     - Webhook handlers (`/api/stripe/webhook`)
  4. Setup Redis (cart cache) + BullMQ (emails)
  5. Validate with Zod schemas
  6. Call MCP tools: `prisma-gen`, `stripe-tool`, `code-gen`
- **Output**: Express/FastAPI backend on localhost:5000 with Stripe working

### **Deployment Guardian** - The Shipper
- **Input**: Test requirements, CI/CD setup, deploy tasks
- **Execution**:
  1. Write Vitest tests (`__tests__/products.test.ts`)
  2. Write Playwright E2E (`e2e/checkout.spec.ts`)
  3. Create GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  4. Deploy frontend to Vercel (`vercel deploy --prod`)
  5. Deploy backend to Railway (`railway up`)
  6. Setup Sentry error tracking
  7. Run Lighthouse CI (score 90+)
  8. Call MCP tools: `vercel-cli`, `docker-build`, `test-runner`
- **Output**: Live URLs + CI green + monitoring active

## 📊 **Expected Flow**

```
User: "Build e-commerce with Stripe..."
  ↓
grok-orc: "🎯 Scope detected! Creating swarm..."
  ↓ (5-12s processing)
grok-orc: "✅ Swarm created! [Planner link]"
  ↓
User: *Clicks planner*
  ↓
UI: Shows 3 tasks × 4 subtasks = 12 items
  ↓
Backend: Agents execute in parallel
  ├─ Frontend Architect → Generates UI code
  ├─ Backend Integrator → Sets up APIs/Stripe
  └─ Deployment Guardian → Writes tests/deploys
  ↓
DB Updates: Tasks change from pending → in-progress → completed
  ↓
Planner UI: Real-time updates (polling every 3s)
  ↓
Final State:
  ✅ Frontend on localhost:3000 (Next.js running)
  ✅ Backend on localhost:5000 (APIs ready)
  ✅ Tests passing (80%+ coverage)
  ✅ Deployed to Vercel + Railway
  ✅ Monitoring active (Sentry)
```

## 🎯 **Verification Checklist**

Before testing, ensure:

- [ ] All 4 API keys in `.env` (check: `cat .env | grep OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)
- [ ] MCP server running on :8001 (check: `curl http://localhost:8001/health`)
- [ ] Swarm API running on :8000 (check: `curl http://localhost:8000`)
- [ ] Frontend running on :3000 (check: open browser)
- [ ] Database exists (check: `ls backend/swarms/active_swarm.db`)

After testing:

- [ ] Chat detected project scope
- [ ] AI responded with swarm creation message
- [ ] Planner link is clickable
- [ ] Planner shows 3 main tasks
- [ ] Each task has 4 subtasks
- [ ] Subtasks have tool badges (browser, code-gen, etc.)
- [ ] Database has swarm record
- [ ] Database has 3 agents (frontend_architect, backend_integrator, deployment_guardian)

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### "Orchestrator API key not configured"
```bash
# Check .env has KEY4
cat .env | grep OPENROUTER_API_KEY4
# Should show: OPENROUTER_API_KEY4=sk-or-v1-...
```

### "Swarm creation timeout"
- Check Terminal 2 logs for errors
- Verify OpenRouter API is not rate-limited
- Reduce scope complexity (try smaller project first)

### "Planner shows no tasks"
```bash
# Check if agents were created
cd backend
sqlite3 swarms/active_swarm.db
SELECT * FROM agents ORDER BY assigned_at DESC LIMIT 3;
# Should show 3 agents with new roles
```

### "Agents stuck on pending"
- This is expected! Agent execution not yet implemented
- Tasks are generated and stored in DB
- Next phase: Implement agent execution loop

---

## 🎉 **YOU'RE READY!**

**Your setup**:
- ✅ grok-orc orchestrator on localhost:3000 chat
- ✅ 3 specialized agents (Frontend/Backend/Deployment)
- ✅ Auto scope breakdown (6 must-haves)
- ✅ Auto planner population (12 modular tasks)
- ✅ Database persistence (SQLite)
- ✅ MCP tool integration ready

**What works NOW**:
1. Dump huge scope in chat
2. AI detects and creates swarm
3. 12 tasks generated and stored
4. Planner UI shows everything

**What's NEXT** (future):
1. Agent execution loop (poll DB → execute MCP tools → update status)
2. Real code generation (agents actually write files)
3. Auto-deploy (Vercel + Railway integration)

**Go ahead and test with that massive e-commerce scope!** 🚀

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09  
**Version**: 2.0 (grok-orc + 3-Agent Diverse Swarm)
