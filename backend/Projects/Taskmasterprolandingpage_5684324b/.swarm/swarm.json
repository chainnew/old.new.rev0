    "goal": "Develop a high-converting landing page for TaskMaster Pro, a pro-level task management platform, to showcase its features and drive user sign-ups. It addresses the pain point of overwhelmed professionals juggling multiple tools by clearly communicating streamlined task tracking, team collaboration, and productivity boosts. The page will feature engaging visuals, testimonials, and CTAs to boost awareness and conversions.",

    "features": [
      "Hero section with compelling headline, subheadline, and primary CTA for sign-up/demo request using Shadcn buttons and cards",
      "Features grid highlighting key benefits like task assignment, real-time collaboration, and analytics dashboards with icons and descriptions",
      "Testimonials carousel from users to build trust, implemented with HeadlessUI or Shadcn components",
      "Pricing teaser section with basic/pro tiers and Stripe integration placeholder for future",
      "Contact form for inquiries using React Hook Form + Zod validation, connected to backend for email notifications",
      "Footer with navigation links, social proof, and secondary CTA"
    ],
    "comps": [
      "Trello (visually engaging boards / landing page lacks depth in pro features)",
      "Asana (comprehensive workflows / overwhelming hero section for quick scans)",
      "Todoist (simple and clean / minimal emphasis on enterprise collaboration)"
