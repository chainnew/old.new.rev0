# TrackFlow

> 🤖 **Auto-generated by old.new AI Swarm Platform**

## 📋 Project Overview

Create a modern, responsive landing page for TaskMaster Pro to showcase its project management capabilities for remote teams struggling with collaboration and task tracking. The page will highlight key features, pricing options, and testimonials to drive sign-ups and conversions. This addresses the pain point of scattered tools and poor visibility in remote work environments by presenting a unified, intuitive SaaS solution.

## ✨ Features

- Features grid displaying 6 key features (e.g., task assignment, real-time collaboration, integrations, reporting, mobile access, AI suggestions) using cards with icons and descriptions
- Pricing table with 3 tiers (Free: basic tasks; Pro: advanced collaboration + $10/mo; Enterprise: custom + support + $50/mo) including feature comparisons and upgrade CTAs
- Customer testimonials section with 4-6 quotes, avatars, and company logos in a carousel or grid layout
- Footer with social media links (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub), copyright, and quick links to privacy/terms
- Overall responsive design with mobile-first approach, purple/blue gradient theme, and SEO-optimized meta tags
