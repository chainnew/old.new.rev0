# Current Status - What Works & What Doesn't

## ✅ What's WORKING:

### 1. Chat → Swarm Trigger
- **File**: `app/api/chat/route.ts`
- Landing page requests trigger MODE 2 (Swarm Creation)
- Swarm gets created via `/orchestrator/process`
- Response includes `<!-- SWARM_META:swarm_id -->`

### 2. AI Planner Display
- **Files**: `components/ui/animated-ai-chat.tsx`, `components/ui/agent-plan.tsx`
- Frontend parses SWARM_META from chat response
- Auto-opens planner panel
- Fetches tasks from `/api/planner/{swarm_id}`
- Displays hierarchical task tree with subtasks
- Polls every 3 seconds for updates

### 3. Backend API
- **File**: `backend/swarm_api.py`
- Running on port 8000
- `/swarms` - List all swarms ✅
- `/api/planner/{swarm_id}` - Get task tree ✅
- `/swarms/{swarm_id}` - Get swarm details ✅

### 4. Database
- **File**: `backend/swarms/active_swarm.db`
- 6 swarms exist with full metadata
- Tasks with subtasks properly structured
- Agents assigned to swarms

### 5. Workspace Manager
- **File**: `backend/agents/project_workspace.py`
- Creates `Projects/ProjectName_swarmId/` folders
- Scaffolds package.json, tsconfig, README
- Has `write_file()` method ready to use

### 6. UI Component Database
- **File**: `backend/data/ui_components.db`
- 218 production components ready
- Frontend Architect knows to query before generating

## ❌ What's NOT Working (The Gap):

### The Missing Link: Agent Execution

**The Problem:**
1. ✅ Swarm gets created
2. ✅ Tasks get generated
3. ✅ Planner displays tasks
4. ❌ **NO AGENT ACTUALLY EXECUTES THE TASKS**
5. ❌ No code gets generated
6. ❌ No files get written to Projects/
7. ❌ Code editor shows mock files, not real ones

**Why:**
- Agents are created in database as records
- But there's no **agent executor** that:
  - Picks up pending tasks
  - Calls Grok with agent-specific prompts
  - Parses code from response
  - Writes files via `workspace_manager.write_file()`
  - Marks tasks as completed

**What Exists:**
- ✅ Agent prompts (`backend/agent_prompts.py`) - Specialized prompts ready
- ✅ Workspace manager - File writing ready
- ✅ Project folders - Auto-created
- ❌ **Agent executor loop** - DOESN'T EXIST

## 🔧 What Needs to Be Built:

### Option 1: Simple Demo (Quick)
Create a quick file writer that generates starter files when swarm is created:
- Orchestrator creates swarm
- Immediately writes 3-4 example files to Projects/ folder
- Files show in code editor
- User sees the flow working

**Time**: 30 minutes
**Result**: Demo works, not production-ready

### Option 2: Real Agent Executor (Production)
Build the full agent execution system:
- Background worker picks up tasks from database
- Calls Grok with agent-specific prompts
- Parses code blocks from responses
- Writes files via workspace manager
- Updates task status in database
- Planner shows real-time progress

**Time**: 4-6 hours
**Result**: Production-ready, fully autonomous

## 📊 Current Architecture:

```
User Input
    ↓
Chat API (detects scope)
    ↓
Orchestrator (/orchestrator/process)
    ├─→ Creates Swarm (DB)
    ├─→ Generates Tasks (DB)
    ├─→ Creates Project Folder (Projects/)
    └─→ Assigns Agents (DB)

[GAP: No agent executor]

⚠️ Tasks sit in DB forever, never executed
⚠️ No code generated
⚠️ No files written
```

**What's Missing:**
```
Agent Executor Loop (DOESN'T EXIST YET):
    while True:
        task = get_pending_task()
        agent = get_agent_for_task(task)

        code = call_grok_with_agent_prompt(agent, task)
        files = parse_code_blocks(code)

        for file in files:
            workspace_manager.write_file(project_dir, file.path, file.content)

        mark_task_completed(task)
```

---

## 🎯 Recommendation:

**For immediate demo:**
Start with Option 1 - Add quick file generation on swarm creation so you can see the complete flow working.

**For production:**
Build Option 2 - The real agent executor that autonomously generates code.

Which would you like me to implement first?
